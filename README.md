## 🚀 About Me
I am a DevOps Engineer with a deep focus on Robotic Process Automation (RPA). My background in operations allows me to see the big picture, but my passion lies in the details of automating it.

I specialize in building resilient automation workflows using **Rewst**, streamlining deployment pipelines, and removing manual toil through intelligent scripting and containerization.

## 🧑‍💻 What Drives Me
I love solving complex problems by creating systems that run themselves. My goal is to optimize workflows to the point where human intervention is the exception, not the rule.
